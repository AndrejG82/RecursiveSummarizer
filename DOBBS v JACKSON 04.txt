The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, which means that states are now able to ban abortion. This will have a particularly hard impact on low-income women, who will not be able to afford to travel to states where abortion is still legal. Many will be forced to turn to illegal and unsafe abortions, which could lead to their death.
