Alice is sitting on a riverbank with her sister, feeling bored and drowsy. She sees a white rabbit running by and, curiosity getting the better of her, follows it down a rabbit hole. She falls for a long time before landing in a strange hall with many doors. She finds a key to fit one of the doors, but when she unlocks it, she finds only a tiny door too small for her to fit through. She then finds a cake with “EAT ME” written on it and, after eating a piece, shrinks until she can fit through the tiny door. On the other side is a beautiful garden, but she is soon confronted by a large, angry-looking cat. She escapes by climbing a tree.

Alice falls down a rabbit hole and finds herself in a long, dark tunnel. She eventually comes to a small door and uses a key to unlock it. The door leads to a small passage, which Alice follows until she comes to a small room. The room is empty except for a table and a chair, and on the table is a small golden key. Alice pocketed the key and then explored the rest of the room, eventually finding a door that was too small for her to fit through. She tried the key in the lock and found that it fit, so she opened the door and squeezed through.

Alice is in a dark hall, longing to get into a beautiful garden she can see through a doorway. She tries to get her head through the doorway, but she's too big. She wishes she could shrink like a telescope. Alice finds a key and a little bottle on a table. The bottle is labeled "DRINK ME," soAlice drinks some of the contents. Suddenly, she shrinks! She's now the right size to go through the doorway into the garden. First, she waits to see if she'll shrink any further. Then she goes into the garden and has a wonderful time. She eventually falls asleep. When Alice wakes up, she's back in the dark hall, and she's back to her original size. She can't find the key or the bottle. She starts to cry, but she scolds herself and decides to leave the dark hall.

Alice finds a cake with the words "EAT ME" written in currants and decides to eat it. She grows either larger or smaller, depending on how much she eats. She grows so large that her head hits the roof and she shrinks so small that her feet are almost out of sight. She tries to remember who she is and where she come from, but she can't. The White Rabbit returns and is surprised to see Alice. He drops his gloves and fan and runs away. Alice picks up the gloves and fan and continues to fan herself. She grows larger and larger until she is bigger than the house. She decides to go outside and shrinks down to a small size. She comes across a glass table with a tiny key on it. She picks up the key and unlocks the door to the garden.

Alice is swimming in a pool of her own tears, wondering how she got there, when she suddenly shrinks down to nine feet tall. She realizes that she must have been changed for Mabel, and that the only way to change back is to go and live in the poky little house. However, she decides that she would rather stay down here and be somebody else. She then finds a little door and a key, and tries to open the door, but it is too small. She shrinks down again and tries to open the door, but this time she is too big. She then hears someone coming, and hides behind a curtain.

Alice sees something splashing about in the pool and swims over to investigate. She finds it is only a mouse that has slipped in like herself. Alice wonders if it would be any use to speak to the mouse, and decides to try. She begins by asking the mouse if it knows the way out of the pool. The mouse looks at her inquisitively but says nothing. Alice wonders if the mouse doesn't understand English, and decides it must be a French mouse that came over with William the Conqueror. She tries again, this time in French, but the mouse only leaps out of the water in fright. Alice apologizes, saying she forgot the mouse didn't like cats. The mouse responds angrily, saying that its family has always hated cats. Alice hurriedly changes the subject, asking if the mouse is fond of dogs. The mouse doesn't answer, so Alice continues, telling the mouse about a nice little dog near her house. The mouse swims away in anger and Alice calls after it, promising not to talk about cats or dogs if the mouse comes back. The mouse swims back and agrees to tell Alice its story. The story turns out to be quite long, and by the time the mouse is finished, the pool is quite full of animals that have fallen in. Alice leads the way out and the whole party swims to shore.

Alice and the other animals are sitting on the bank, wet and uncomfortable. They discuss how to get dry again and Alice finds herself talking to them as if she has known them all her life. The Mouse, who seems to be in charge, tells them to sit down and be quiet while it dries them off. The Mouse starts reciting a long history, but the Lory interrupts, shivering. The Mouse scolds the Lory and continues reciting. The Duck interrupts, asking what the Mouse is talking about. The Mouse gets cross and tells the Duck to listen. The Mouse continues reciting, but Alice is still wet. The Dodo suddenly stands up and says they need to take more drastic measures. It suggests a Caucus-race, but no one knows what that is. The Dodo explains that they will all run around in a circle and whoever wants to can start and stop running whenever they want. They all start running and after a while the Dodo calls out that the race is over. They all crowd around, panting, and ask who won. The Dodo can't answer and they all go their separate ways.

Alice is sitting with the Dodo bird and a group of other animals, who are all waiting in silence. The Dodo suddenly speaks up, saying that everyone has won and deserves a prize. When asked who will give out the prizes, the Dodo points to Alice. Alice has no idea what to do, but she remembers she has a box of candy in her pocket. She hands out the candy as prizes, but the Dodo says she must have a prize herself. All Alice has is a thimble, which she reluctantly hands over. The next thing is to eat the candy, which causes some chaos as the larger birds can't taste theirs and the smaller ones start choking. Once that's over, they all sit down and the Mouse starts to tell them a story. Alice is only half paying attention, so her version of the story is very different from the Mouse's. The Mouse gets angry and walks away, leaving the others disappointed. Alice calls after it, begging it to come back and finish the story, but the Mouse only shakes its head and keeps walking.

Alice encounters a group of birds who are shocked to hear that her cat, Dinah, likes to eat them. They all fly away except for one old Magpie, who tells Alice that she must be getting home. Alice is left alone and feels sad that nobody likes Dinah. Soon, she hears the sound of footsteps and hopes it is the Mouse returning to finish his story. However, it is only the White Rabbit, who is looking for his fan and gloves. The Rabbit mistakes Alice for his housemaid and orders her to go fetch them. Alice decides to comply, hoping that she can find the Rabbit's fan and gloves while also looking for her own. She comes across a neat little house with a brass plate that reads "W. RABBIT" and goes inside. Alice finds the fan and gloves but also notices a bottle of liquid. She decides to drink it, hoping it will make her grow large again.

Alice finds herself in a room that is growing smaller as she drinks from a magic bottle. She soon realizes that she is in danger of being crushed and sticks her arm out the window and her foot up the chimney. Suddenly, the room stops shrinking. Alice then hears the voice of the Rabbit outside and realizes that it is coming for her. She tries to grab it, but only succeeds in knocking over a cucumber frame. The Rabbit is angry and tells Alice to go away. There is a long silence and then Alice hears whispers. She eventually falls asleep.

Alice is sitting by the window in a house when she sees a group of animals and birds outside. One of the animals, a little lizard called Bill, is in the middle of the group, being held up by two guinea pigs. The guinea pigs are giving Bill something out of a bottle. When Alice appears, the group rushes towards her, but she runs away and finds herself in a wood. Alice decides that the first thing she needs to do is find out what the animals and birds are doing. She comes across a small rabbit, who tells her that they are going to burn down the house. Alice is shocked and tells the rabbit that if they do, she will set her cat, Dinah, on them. The rabbit is silent for a moment before telling Alice that they need a barrowful of things to burn the house down. Alice decides to eat one of the cakes that the animals were throwing at her earlier. After eating it, she finds that she has shrunk in size. She is now small enough to fit through the door and runs out of the house. The animals and birds are gone when Alice exits the house. She sees Bill, the lizard, lying on the ground. She tries to give him some of the cake, but it turns into pebbles when she tries to break it. Alice picks up one of the pebbles and puts it in her pocket.

Alice is in a wood and she wants to get back to her original size and find her way into a lovely garden. She meets a puppy who is very large. The puppy is friendly and wants to play with Alice, but Alice is afraid that the puppy might be hungry and eat her. Alice tries to escape from the puppy, but it follows her. She runs until she is very tired and the puppy is far away. Alice then meets a caterpillar who is smoking a hookah. The caterpillar asks Alice who she is and Alice tells him that she doesn't really know. The caterpillar tells her that she needs to eat or drink something. Alice doesn't see anything that she thinks she should eat or drink. There is a mushroom near her and she decides to see if there is anything on top of it. When she looks over the edge of the mushroom, she sees the caterpillar. The caterpillar tells her that she needs to eat a piece of the mushroom. Alice does not want to eat the mushroom, but she takes a small bite of it anyway. After she eats the mushroom, she grows very tall.

Alice encounters a caterpillar and they begin speaking to one another. The caterpillar asks Alice why she is so confused and Alice responds by asking the caterpillar who it is. The caterpillar then asks Alice why she should tell her who it is and Alice doesn't have a good answer. The caterpillar tells Alice to keep her temper and Alice complies. The caterpillar then asks Alice if she has tried to say the alphabet and Alice says she has. The caterpillar tells Alice to recite a poem called "You are old, Father William" and Alice does so. The caterpillar criticizes Alice's recitation and tells her that she is wrong from beginning to end. The caterpillar then asks Alice what size she wants to be and Alice says she doesn't know. The caterpillar tells Alice that she will have to change sizes multiple times and Alice doesn't like that idea. The caterpillar then tells Alice that she will have to change again and Alice does so.

Alice encounters a Caterpillar smoking a hookah on a mushroom and having a conversation. The Caterpillar tells Alice that she will grow taller on one side of the mushroom and shorter on the other. After a while, the Caterpillar disappears and Alice is left alone with the mushroom. Alice nibbles on the mushroom and suddenly her chin is struck by her own foot which she can no longer see. Alice continues to eat the mushroom and shrinks until her head is the only part of her body remaining. Suddenly, a pigeon appears and accuses Alice of being a serpent. Alice insists she is not a serpent, but the pigeon does not believe her. The pigeon goes on to say that Alice is just like all the other serpents who are difficult to please.

The Pigeon is sitting in its nest on top of a tree, when Alice comes by. The Pigeon is upset because Alice is disturbing its eggs, but Alice is confused because she doesn't see any eggs. The Pigeon explains that it is constantly on the lookout for serpents, which have been bothering it for the past three weeks. Alice is sympathetic, but the Pigeon doesn't believe her and accuses her of being a serpent in disguise. Alice insists that she is not a serpent, but the Pigeon doesn't believe her. The Pigeon finally tells Alice to go away and leave it alone. Alice walks away from the Pigeon and comes across a small house. She is curious to know who lives there, but is afraid of being seen. She decides to nibble on a piece of mushroom to shrink down to a smaller size. After she does this, she approaches the house and sees a footman in livery come out. The footman has a letter for the Duchess. Alice is curious to know what is going on, so she follows the footman.

Alice is walking in the woods when she comes across a Frog-Footman and a Fish-Footman. The Frog-Footman tells her that the Duchess has been invited to play croquet with the Queen, and the Fish-Footman says that the Queen has invited Alice to play as well. Both Footmen then bow, and their curls get tangled together. Alice laughs and runs away, but when she looks back, the Fish-Footman is gone and the Frog-Footman is sitting on the ground, staring up at the sky. Alice goes up to the door of the Duchess's house and knocks, but the Frog-Footman tells her that there's no use in knocking because he's on the same side of the door as she is and also because of the noise coming from inside the house. Alice can hear a lot of crashing and breaking inside, and she also hears the Duchess sneezing. The Frog-Footman tells Alice that she can do anything she likes, and he starts whistling. Alice goes into the house and finds the Duchess sitting in the middle of the kitchen, nursing a baby. The cook is at the stove, stirring a pot of soup, and there is a large cat sitting on the hearth, grinning. Alice asks the Duchess why the cat is grinning, and the Duchess tells her that it's a Cheshire cat and that's why. The Duchess then tells Alice that all cats can grin and most of them do.

Alice is sitting with the Duchess and the cook when the latter suddenly starts throwing things at the former. The Duchess does not react, and Alice is terrified that the baby will be hurt. The cook then tells Alice off for minding her own business, and the Duchess says that if everyone did that, the world would go round a lot faster. Alice tries to explain that this would not be an advantage, but the Duchess is not interested and starts singing a lullaby to the baby, shaking it violently. The cook then tells Alice she can nurse the baby if she likes, and throws a frying pan at the Duchess as she leaves. Alice manages to catch the baby and takes it outside. She is worried that if she leaves it with the Duchess and the cook, they will kill it, so she decides to take it with her.

Alice is talking to the Cheshire Cat, who has just told her that she is going to turn into a pig. Alice is not very pleased with this prospect, and wonders what she will do with the creature when she gets it home. The Cat then tells her about the Hatter and the March Hare, who both live nearby, and advises Alice to visit them if she wants to get somewhere. Alice decides to visit the March Hare, as she thinks he will be the most interesting, and perhaps not as mad as he was in March. On the way, she meets the Cat again, who asks her if she said 'pig' or 'fig'. Alice is not sure what he means, and the Cat disappears again. Alice eventually arrives at the March Hare's house, where she finds him and the Hatter having a tea party. The Hatter asks Alice a series of nonsensical questions, and she soon realizes that they are all mad. However, she enjoys the tea party and eventually leaves. As she is walking away, she meets the Cat again, who asks her if she knows the way to the Queen's croquet ground. Alice says she does not, and the Cat disappears once more.

Alice encounters a talking pig, who tells her to follow him. She does so, and he leads her to a large house. The pig then disappears and Alice is left alone. She approaches the house and is greeted by the March Hare and the Hatter, who invite her to have tea with them. The Dormouse is also present, fast asleep. Alice takes a seat and the March Hare offers her some wine. When Alice points out that there is no wine, the March Hare gets angry and tells her she should have known better than to sit down without being invited. The Hatter then tells Alice that her hair needs cutting. The conversation turns to riddles and the Hatter asks Alice why a raven is like a writing desk. Alice is unable to answer. The Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse then all take turns asking Alice impossible riddles. Frustrated, Alice stands up to leave, but is stopped by the Hatter, who asks her what day of the month it is. When Alice tells him, he informs her that she is two days off and that this is the reason his watch isn't working properly. The Hatter's watch begins ticking again and he, the March Hare, and the Dormouse all vanish.

Alice encounters the Hatter and the March Hare having tea. The Hatter is upset because the March Hare put the butter in the tea with the bread-knife, ruining the tea. Alice is curious about the Hatter's watch and comments on how it only tells the day of the month, to which the Hatter replies that Alice's watch probably doesn't tell the year. The Hatter and the March Hare begin to argue about time and Alice is confused. The Hatter explains that they keep time by having tea all the time and never washing the dishes. Alice is horrified by this and the Hatter tells her that it's all because Time is a murderer.

Alice, the March Hare, and the Hatter are sitting around a table drinking tea. The Hatter and the March Hare are getting tired of Alice, so they ask her to tell them a story. The Dormouse, who has been asleep the whole time, is woken up and also asked to tell a story. The Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters who live at the bottom of a well. They live on treacle and are very ill. Alice is confused by the story and asks questions. The Hatter and the March Hare get impatient with her and tell her to finish the story herself. Alice tries to finish the story, but she is not very good at it. The Hatter and the March Hare make fun of her and she gets angry. She tells them off and they all move to different seats around the table.

Alice encounters a group of gardeners who are painting roses red. They tell her that they are doing this because the Queen will be coming soon and they don't want her to know that they accidentally planted a white rose tree. Alice is curious and asks to see the Queen. The gardeners oblige and show her a group of ten soldiers, ten courtiers, and ten royal children, all of whom are decorated with hearts. The guests then come out, mostly elderly women. Finally, the Queen herself appears. She is a very large woman with a crown and a sceptre. She sits down and begins playing croquet with the guests. Alice is fascinated by the game and watches for a while. Soon, she gets bored and decided to leave. As she is leaving, she hears the Queen sentence the gardeners to death for their mistake. Alice is horrified and decides to speak up. She tells the Queen that she is being unfair and that the gardeners should be pardoned. The Queen is not happy with Alice's interference and orders her execution. Alice wakes up from her dream, relieved that it was all just a dream.

Alice is walking through a forest when she comes across a White Rabbit. The White Rabbit is talking to itself in a hurried, nervous manner and doesn't notice Alice. Alice then sees a Knave of Hearts carrying a King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion. Following the Knave is the King and Queen of Hearts. The Queen notices Alice and asks who she is. Alice introduces herself and the Queen asks Alice what she is doing there. Alice responds that she doesn't know and the Queen gets angry, screaming for Alice's head. The King calms the Queen down and she asks the Knave to turn over the three gardeners lying on the ground. The gardeners are actually soldiers in disguise and the Queen orders their heads to be cut off. Alice protects the soldiers and puts them in a flower pot. The Queen asks Alice if she can play croquet and Alice responds that she can. The White Rabbit whispers to Alice that the Duchess is under sentence of execution.

Alice encounters a number of curious creatures while playing croquet with the Queen. Among them is the Cheshire Cat, who she strikes up a conversation with. The Cat tells Alice that the Queen is not playing fair and that she is likely to win the game. The Queen overhears this and becomes angry with Alice. The King then speaks to Alice, asking who she was talking to. Alice tells him it is a friend of hers, a Cheshire Cat.

Alice meets the King and Queen, who are arguing with the executioner about whether or not it is possible to behead something without a body. Alice is asked to settle the argument, and she suggests that they ask the Duchess, who is in prison. The executioner goes to fetch her, and while he is gone, the Cat's head disappears. The Duchess is in a good mood when she returns, and she and Alice walk off together. Alice reflects on how the Duchess was so savage when they first met in the kitchen, and wonders if it was the pepper that made her that way. The Duchess begins telling Alice a story about a Mock Turtle.

Alice is sitting with the Duchess, who is unpleasantly close to her and keeps digging her chin into Alice's shoulder. They discuss the moral of a story, and the Duchess insists that everything has a moral. Alice demurs, saying that some things may not have a moral. The Duchess then goes on to tell Alice that the moral of the story is that "it is love that makes the world go round." Alice replies that someone once said that it is actually done by everyone minding their own business. The Duchess agrees, saying that it is the same thing. The Duchess then asks Alice why she isn't putting her arm around Alice's waist, and Alice replies that she is afraid the Duchess's flamingo might bite her. The Duchess says that the moral of that is "birds of a feather flock together." Alice points out that mustard is not a bird, to which the Duchess replies that the moral of that is "the more there is of mine, the less there is of yours." Alice insists that mustard is actually a vegetable, and the Duchess agrees, saying that the moral of that is "be what you would seem to be." The Duchess then tells Alice that she is welcome to everything she has said so far, and Alice politely declines. The Duchess then says that if she wanted to, she could say much more. Alice is beginning to feel worried, and the Duchess's voice suddenly dies away in the middle of her sentence. Alice looks up and sees that the Duchess has turned into a pig.

Alice is playing croquet with the Queen when she is suddenly summoned to speak with her. The Queen is very angry and tells Alice that she must either leave or be put to death. Alice chooses to leave, and the Queen tells her to go see the Mock Turtle. Alice meets the Gryphon, who tells her that the Mock Turtle is very sad and has been crying. They go to see him and the Gryphon tells Alice that the Mock Turtle will tell her his story. The Mock Turtle tells Alice that he used to be a real turtle, but he is now just a mock turtle. He tells her about his life and how he became a mock turtle. Alice is very sympathetic and feels sorry for the Mock Turtle. She is also glad when the Gryphon tells her that executions are not really carried out in their world.

The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon are telling Alice about their schooling. The Mock Turtle explains that they went to school in the sea and that the master was an old Turtle called Tortoise. Alice is surprised that they would call him Tortoise if he wasn't one. The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon explain that he was called Tortoise because he taught them. They tell Alice that they had the best education and that they learned French and music. The Mock Turtle says that they also learned washing, but Alice is surprised that they would need to learn that at the bottom of the sea. The Mock Turtle explains that they couldn't afford to learn it. They tell Alice about the different subjects they learned, including reeling and writhing, arithmetic, and drawling. They also tell her about the Mystery and Seaography classes. When Alice asks about the eleventh day, the Mock Turtle tells her that it was a holiday.

The Lobster Quadrille is a dance performed by two lines of people, with each person having a lobster as their partner. The dance starts with everyone advancing twice and then changing partners. The new partners then swim out to sea as far as they can and back to land again. The dance ends with everyone changing partners again and retiring in the same order.

Alice is talking to the Mock Turtle and Gryphon about her adventures. The Mock Turtle is particularly interested in the part where Alice repeats "You Are Old, Father William" to the Caterpillar, and the words come out different each time. The Gryphon says that Alice should repeat something for them now, and she agrees. However, she is so distracted by the Lobster Quadrille that she can hardly remember what she is saying. The Mock Turtle and Gryphon are both amused and perplexed by her performance.

Alice is sitting with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle when the Mock Turtle asks about the rhyme Alice was just reciting. The Gryphon hastily tells the Mock Turtle to move on to the next verse, but the Mock Turtle persists, asking about the details of the rhyme. Alice tries to explain, but she is interrupted by the Gryphon, who tells her to move on to the next verse. The Mock Turtle then asks Alice to sing a song, and she gladly agrees. The Mock Turtle sings a beautiful song about soup, and at the end, the Gryphon and Alice hurry off, leaving the Mock Turtle behind. They arrive at a court where the King and Queen of Hearts are seated on their throne, with a crowd of animals and cards gathered around them. The Knave of Hearts is standing in chains in front of them, guarded by two soldiers, and near the King is the White Rabbit, holding a trumpet and a scroll of parchment. In the middle of the court is a table with a large dish of tarts on it. The tarts look so good that Alice is tempted to take one, but she is stopped by the Gryphon, who tells her that the tarts are for the Queen's birthday party and she will be in big trouble if she takes one.

Alice is sitting in a courtroom, waiting for the trial to begin. She is curious about everything in the room and tries to guess what each thing is. She correctly identifies the judge and the jury box, but is unsure about what the twelve creatures in the jury box are. She eventually decides they must be the jurors. The jurors are all writing busily on their slates. Alice is curious about what they could be writing and asks the Gryphon. He tells her they are writing down their names in case they forget them during the trial. Alice is indignant at this and begins to shout, but is quickly silenced by the White Rabbit. The trial begins and the first witness is the Hatter. He comes in with a teacup and a piece of bread and butter. He explains that he was in the middle of his tea when he was summoned. The King is not pleased with this and scolds the Hatter. The Hatter then tells the court the date he believes the tarts were stolen. The March Hare and the Dormouse both give different dates. The King then orders the Hatter to take off his hat. The Hatter explains that it is not his hat, but the King does not believe him and the jury makes a note of it.

The Hatter is on trial for allegedly murdering the March Hare. The Queen is presiding over the trial, and the Hatter is the only witness. The Hatter is extremely nervous, and he fumbles his way through his testimony. At one point, he even bites a piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. Alice is sitting in the courtroom, and she begins to grow larger again. The Dormouse, who is sitting next to her, complains that Alice is squishing him. Alice and the Dormouse argue back and forth for a bit, until finally the Dormouse crosses over to the other side of the courtroom. The Hatter's testimony continues, and he eventually gets to the part where the Dormouse said something. However, the Hatter can't remember what the Dormouse said, and the King gets angry. The Hatter is about to be executed, when one of the guinea-pigs in the courtroom cheers. The guinea-pig is immediately suppressed by the court officers. Alice is surprised by this, and she thinks to herself that she's glad she finally understands what "attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court" means. The Hatter is allowed to sit down, and the trial proceeds. However, the second guinea-pig in the courtroom cheers, and he too is suppressed. Eventually, the Hatter finishes his testimony and the trial is over. Alice is relieved, and she thinks to herself that now they can get on better.

Alice is called as a witness in the trial of the singers, and she testifies that she knows nothing about the case. The White Rabbit interrupts her, saying that she means "unimportant," of course. The King tells the jury to disregard the Rabbit's comment and to continue writing down Alice's testimony. However, the Lizard is so overcome with emotion that it can't write, and the Queen orders it to be removed from the courtroom.

Alice is on trial for a crime, and the jury is deliberating. The King asks them to consider their verdict carefully, as there is more evidence to come. The White Rabbit then presents a letter that he says was written by Alice. The letter is actually a set of verses, and it is not clear who the verses are addressed to. The jury is not sure what to make of the verses, and Alice tells them that they don't make any sense. The King then says that the verses prove Alice's guilt, but Alice disagrees.

Alice falls asleep by a river and has a curious dream in which she is put on trial for stealing the Queen's tarts. The evidence against her is entirely circumstantial, but the jury finds her guilty and she is sentenced to death. However, before the sentence can be carried out, Alice wakes up and realizes it was all just a dream.

Alice is sitting on the riverbank with her sister when she notices a white rabbit running by. She follows the rabbit down a hole, and finds herself in Wonderland. She has a series of adventures, meeting peculiar creatures like the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat. Eventually, she is put on trial by the Queen of Hearts, and is sentenced to death. However, she escapes and wakes up, finding that it was all a dream.
